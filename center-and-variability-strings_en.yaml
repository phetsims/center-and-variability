      At edge of field, up to {$maxBalls} kickers are ready to kick a soccer ball a random distance between 1 and 15
      meters. Stacks of balls form when they land at the same distance. A sortable data card appears for each kicked
      ball recording the kick distance. Each ball can be moved to adjust its kick distance. There are checkboxes to
      auto-sort the data cards and highlight or predict the median.
